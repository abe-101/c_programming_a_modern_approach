### Chapter 14, Exercise 07

Let `GENERIC_MAX` be the following macro:

```
#define GENERIC_MAX(type)       \
type type##_max(type x, type y) \
{                               \
    return x > y ? x : y;       \
}
```

(a) Show the preprocessor's expansion of `GENERIC_MAX(long)`.  
(b) Explain why `GENERIC_MAX` doesn't work for basic types such as `unsigned
long`.  
(c) Describe a technique that would allow us to use `GENERIC_MAX` with basic
types such as `unsigned long`. *Hint:* Don't change the definition of
`GENERIC_MAX`.

### Solution

#### (a)

```c
long long_max(long x, long y)
{
    return x > y ? x : y;
}
```
#### (b)

Types including a space charactor in their name will not work for this function creation because of the `##` operator in th macro definition, illegally creating a function `unsigned long unsigned long_max()`.

#### (c)

we can first assign a basic type that has one or more spaces in it to a custom typedef name without spaces. E.g:
`typedef unsigned long u_long;`
Now when we pass u\_long to the GENERIC\_MAX macro, it can create a function name by joining the tokens u\_long and _max to create u_long\_max.
