### Chapter 17 Exercise 15

Show the output of the following program and explain what it does.

```c
include <stdio.h>

int f1(int (*f)(int));
int f2(int i);

int main(void)
{
    printf("Answer: %d\n", f1(f2));
    return 0;
}

int f1(int (*f)(int))
{
    int n = 0;

    while ((*f)(n)) n++;
    return n;
}

int f2(int i)
{
    return i * i + i - 12;
}
```

### Solution
f1 calls f2 with n starting at 0 and incrementing after each loop, f2 returns given number times itself and plus itself minus 12, after 4 loops return value is 0 leaving n at the value of 3.
