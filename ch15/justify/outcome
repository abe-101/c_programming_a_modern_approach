C is quirky,  flawed,  and  an  enormous  success.  Although
accidents of history surely helped, it evidently satisfied a
need for a system implementation language  efficient  enough
to displaces assembly language, ye  sufficinietly  abstraact
and fluent to describe algorithms and interactions in a wode
varient of encironments. -- Dennis M. Ritchie
