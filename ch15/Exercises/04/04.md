### Chapter 15 Exercise 04

(a) What is the output when the program is executed?  
(b) What is the output if the `#define` directive is removed from `testdebug.c`?  
(c) Explain why the output is different in parts (a) and (b).  
(d) Is it necessary for the `DEBUG` macro to be defined *before* `debug.h` is
included in order for `PRINT_DEBUG` to have the desired effect? Justify your
answer.

### Solution

#### (a)
```
Output if DBUG is defined:
value of i: 1
value of j: 2
value of k: 3
value of i + j: 3
value of 2 * i + j - k: 1
```
#### (b)

```
Output if DEBUG is not defined:
```

#### (c)

Because the `DEBUG` macro was left undefined while `debug.h` was added to
`testdebug.c`, the `PRINT_DEBUG` macro was defined as a macro with no effect,
and the preprocessor conditional statements also relied on the definition of
`DEBUG`.

#### (d)

Yes. The `PRINT_DEBUG` macro's definition relies on the definition of `DEBUG`.
If `DEBUG` is defined after `PRINT_DEBUG` is defined, it will have no effect on
the definition of `PRINT_DEBUG`.
