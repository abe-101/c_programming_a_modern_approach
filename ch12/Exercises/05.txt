(a) p == a[0]   Illegal - &a[0] compared to a[0]
(b) p == &a[0]  Legal   - &a[0] compared to &a[0]
(c) *p == a[0]  Legal   - *&a[0] (which is the same as a[0]) compared to a[0]
(d) p[0] ==a[0] Legal   - *(p + 0) compared to a[0]

(b), (c) and (d) are true because when p is assigned to a, it points to the
first element in a (a[0]).
